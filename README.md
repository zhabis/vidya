# VIDYA
Vidya JS - a full stack server and client Java Script Library.

Full stack runs on:
* Server - core runs on Node.js (no browser-polution)
* Client - for browser/HTML + SPA + Full UI library of 10+ base widgets done in a classic RAD (Rapid Application Development) style.

For client programming, Vidya borrows the influence of React+Flux doing smart control-level differencing 
on the data layer (not in DOM), releaving memory pressure and working faster (no need to store and do DOM tree).

The cutting edge Java Script Library engineered around ES6 - ECMA2017:
* Classes - "classic" OOP
* Asynchronous Flows / Promisses
* Generators 
* Iterable + Deferred execution a-la LINQ
* Symbols, Literals etc.

Features

* Averments (checks a-la Assert -> Aver)
* Type coercion, conversion
* String manipulation + formatting
* I18n/Localization of money, dates
* Functional style defferred pipeline aka LINQ (select(), where(), any(), all(), distinct(), count(0 etc...)
*
