# Contributing to Vidya.js

## Chief Principles

* Keep Code clean
* Unless you are writing plugins, **Avoid 3rd party refs** - 
know what has already been written, most likely the functinality is already built-in
* Write JS Doc for every public member
* Comment code in plain English
* Maintain proper de-coupling/segregation of server and UI/client


## Naming Conventions
* PascalCase for classes
* camelCase for functions and properties
* UPPER_CASE for constants
* protected memebrs start with _ (underscore)
* private fields start with m_

WIP, TBD...
